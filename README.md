Welcome to the Glitch TypeScript Base
======================================

This project is the same as Glitch Welcome Project, but running on TypeScript.

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.

Glitch is a developer playground that lets you code a real web-app without the slow setup and deployment steps.

Your Project
------------

On the back-end,
- you app gets compiled from TypeScript to JavaScript
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env`

On the front-end,
- edit `client.js`, `style.css` and `index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
